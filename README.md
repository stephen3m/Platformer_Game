## Introduction
I worked on this project during my 2021-2022 winter break to see how Python could be used for designing video games. This program is a platformer game where the goal is to avoid enemies and traps, collect power cubes (3 power cubes = +1 health), and ultimately collect the colorful power cube at the end to win.
## Technologies
